<h1><u>Welcome to everything about Sharks!</u></h1>
	<p>Sharks! Just the thought of them makes some people nervous! These beasts of the sea are some of the most advanced predators on the planet, and yet, there is still so much mystery surrounding these highly intelligent creatures. Much of the mystique remains hidden within the shadows of the deep ocean. But nonetheless, they are an integral part of the worlds aquatic ecosystems and they are worthy of our attention and protection.</p>

<h1><u>What is a shark?</u></h1>
<p>Most people probably think of a shark as a swimming animal with big fins and pointy teeth. But how exactly does it fit into the Animal Kingdom? For starters, some of you may be surprised to know that sharks are indeed fish. But they really don't look all that similar to your average gold fish, do they?
There's a good reason for these distinct appearances: while they are both fish, the creatures shown above actually represent two very different "Classes" of animals (see short article on <a style="background-color: #a7aaf1;" href="http://www.the-shark-side-of-life.com/scientific-nomenclature.html">Scientific Nomenclature</a>).

What we think of as the typical fish - goldfish, minnows, salmon - are "bony fish" belonging to Class Osteichthyes. They have a skeleton that is made mostly of bone. In addition, they are agile swimmers that can move forward and backward, and they are found in rivers, lakes and seas.</p>

<h2><u>How are they different?</u></h2>
<p>Sharks, on the other hand, belong to an entirely different group called Class Chondrichthyes (which oddly enough are thought to have evolved from an earlier group of bony fish). Some newer classification schemes instead refer to this as Class Elasmobranchii. Mostly these are marine fish, meaning that they live in salt water. "Cartilaginous" fish or "elasmobranchs" include sharks along with rays, skates, and chimaeras (ratfish): those that lack true bone. Instead, they have a skeleton made of cartilage, reinforced with calcification (calcium builds up in the tissue, causing it to harden). Sharks can only swim forward. This is because unlike in bony fish, their pectoral fins can't bend upwards. Many sharks have to keep swimming in order to breathe.
Among other key distinctions, cartilaginous fish have a unique type of tooth attachment and replacement. Teeth are arranged in many rows that are constantly shed and replaced. Unlike bony fish, whose males and females eject their sperm and eggs into the water to mix, these fish have internal fertilization. "Chondrichthyan" males have organs known as claspers. These are a modified part of the pelvic fins that are inserted into the female cloaca (an opening in the body), so that sperm can be placed inside the females during copulation. Compared to bony fish, Chondrichthyans mature sexually at much greater ages, produce fewer young at a time, and can have very long gestation periods.
