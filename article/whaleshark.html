<h1><u>Whale Shark</u></h1>

<p>The Whale Shark, also called the Rhinocdon typus, is an enormous shark and is only a whale by size. It's actually the biggest shark and fish! Would you believe an average adult is the length of a school bus?! They typically grow to about 10-12 m (33-40 ft), but may reach 18 m (60 ft) in length. They can weigh up to 15 tons. Of course no one really knows for sure, because there isn't much known about the size of whale sharks at maturity. People are truly fascinated by these gentle giants, yet surprisingly little is known about their life history, compared to other large sharks.

I went scuba diving in Zanzibar, in East Africa, and our dive master pointed through the water ahead of us excitedly. I saw a beautiful school of silvery fish swim by. Then my eyes focused just behind the fishes, and I realized they were covering a much bigger creature! It was grey with pale spots, and stretched longer than our whole group of divers. Back in the boat, he explained we had seen "just" a baby whale shark. Imagine what it would be like to swim beside an adult!</p>
