<h1><u>Bull Shark</u></h1>
	<p>The Bull Shark - They're everywhere you wouldn't expect them to be! Known as the Carcharhinus Leucas in the scientific community, it has a stocky figure and a broad, flat snout. This is one of 43 shark species that can live in both seawater and freshwater. That fact alone makes this one of the best known shark species. This species is known by several different names depending on its whereabouts: Zambezi Shark, Nicaragua Shark, or Ganges River Shark.

	But this shark is also known as one of the top 3 sharks most likely to attack humans (the other 2 are the Great White Shark and the Tiger Shark). Of course, we know that shark attacks are extremely rare (less than 4.5 deaths by shark attacks per year globally), but nonetheless, this shark has been nicknamed "The Pit Bull of the Sea" because if its aggressive behavior. 
	While the Bull Shark is one of just 3 shark species to attack humans unprovoked, attacks are extremely rare. Especially when you consider that thousands of people wash their bodies daily in the Ganges River for religious purposes. This just so happens to be a preferred area for the shark.
	This species is not hunted much by humans. The biggest human threat to these creatures are getting caught in fish nets.</p>
