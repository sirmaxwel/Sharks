<h1><u>Tiger Shark</u></h1>

<p>The Tiger Shark, also called Galeocerdo Cuvier in the scientific community, is the only member of the Galeocerdo genus. This shark is an aggressive predator and is found mostly in tropical and warm waters. Being larger than its requiem cousins, they can grow up to a length of 15 - 16 feet or 5 meters and can weigh around 1,800 pounds or 800 kilograms. Imagine having one of those on the end of your fishing pole! There have been isolated cases where they get much larger than that. Also called the sea tiger, they get their name from the tiger like stripes on the body which fades away as it grows older. They also earned the nickname The Wastebasket Of The Sea because they will eat virtually anything, including human garbage and trash which floats out to sea.

Found around the Pacific Islands, the they prefer to hunt in the dark. Their normal prey includes smaller shark species and a variety of fish, dolphins, birds, turtles, crustaceans and squid. In turn they are hunted by humans for game and finning. Because this shark enjoys visiting canals, harbors and shallow reefs, which are often areas used by humans, a tiger Shark is considered dangerous and has the second largest number of attack data after the Great White Shark. It is also prone to being fished out frequently.

This is a prize catch for many fisheries, especially in tropical locations. The sharks skin, fins, liver and flesh are considered to be delicacies. More specifically, the liver is very rich in vitamin A and is used to manufacture vitamin pills. Due to such heavy fishing practices, the population of this shark has dwindled.

Currently, the Tiger Shark is considered near threatened due to its hunting by humans. They've also been recently put on the Marine red list, which makes it illegal to fish or hunt Tiger Sharks across the world.</p>
