<h1><u>About Us</u><h1>
	<p>Hi there, and thanks for visiting sharkyshark.com! All of the writers here have a 		  passion for sharks and are aimed at educating the public on their importance in the ecosystem.
	Sharks are a wildly misunderstood species. To make matters worse, hardly anyone is educated about sharks aside from what they hear on TV, in the movies, or in the news. You can hardly even find any info about sharks on the internet, which is why this site was born!</p>
•  •  •
<h2><u>Where these shark facts come from</u></h2>
	<p>Most of the main articles on this website have been written by University Students 	majoring in subjects such as Marine Biology. We also have articles written by people who have gone swimming with sharks and other articles have been written by volunteers. All visitor submitted articles have a note on the top of the article letting you know who it was written by.

	We can't guarantee the accuracy of everything you find here. We wish we could, but this website is run by a very small number of people. What we can guarantee is that all the facts you find here have been researched and confirmed using various online and offline resources. So it should be pretty darn accurate.

<h2><u>Thanks for stopping by</u></h2>
	<p>Hey thanks a lot for coming by and if you know anybody who is interested in sharks, please share this site with them. If you know somebody that isn't interested in sharks, you should especially send this site to them!! Let's spread the knowledge!
	Of course, we can't vouch for visitor submitted articles, but we do read through them and correct any errors we find before posting them.</p>
